#the __init__.py file is used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories.

# When importing a module from a package, Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package subdirectory.

# The __init__.py file can contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
